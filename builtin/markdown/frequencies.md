# Frequencies

Enter queries in the text box below. Use semicolons to make multiple queries, as in `civilian; affected population` (case insensitive). Pipes `|` can be used to combine multiple words `war|conflict`.

Frequencies include matches for exact words (`be`, `person`) and their variations when possible (`be|is|being|was`, `person|persons` - but not necessarily `people`).
