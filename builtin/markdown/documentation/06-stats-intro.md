See Sketch Engine's [user guide](https://www.sketchengine.eu/guide/) for more information on interpreting corpus data, particularly the glossary and details on statistics.

- detailed analysis is needed to make strong claims
  - small text types can have disproportionately large densities
  - sources of noise may influence frequencies
- it's helpful to compare baselines and obvious trends
  - try `that` to see how stable its results are over time
  - try `twitter` to see a clear growth over time
  - the latest year a corpus is available may not include a full 12 months of data
