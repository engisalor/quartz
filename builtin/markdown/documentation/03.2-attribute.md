### Multivalue attributes

While some attributes, like timestamps or URLs, have a single unique value, others can have several at once. One example is that a document `theme` that could include a list of topics, like Food, Education, and Sanitation. This is tagged in a corpus as a single string with a separator between values (`Food|Education|Sanitation`).

Multivalues can include repeated values, like `source type` = `NGO|NGO`. In this case  two organizations of the same type are listed in another attribute: `source name` = `UN Environment Programme|UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs`.

When frequencies are calculated for attributes with multivalues, a document is only counted once regardless of any repeated multivalues. If a corpus with one document has `source type` = `NGO|NGO|NGO|IGO`, the total count for `NGO` documents is always `1`.

Multivalue attributes are generally unique to each corpus (if they include any): see details for a corpus in the Corpora page.
